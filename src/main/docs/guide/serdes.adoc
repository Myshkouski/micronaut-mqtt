The serialization and deserialization of message payloads is handled through instances of api:mqtt.serdes.MqttPayloadSerDes[]. The ser-des (Serializer/Deserializer) is responsible for both serialization and deserialization of MQTT message payloads into the types defined in your publisher and subscriber methods.

The ser-des are managed by a api:mqtt.serdes.MqttPayloadSerDesRegistry[]. All ser-des beans are injected in order into the registry and then searched for when serialization or deserialization is needed. The first ser-des that returns true for api:mqtt.serdes.MqttPayloadSerDes#supports-java.lang.Class-[MqttPayloadSerDes#supports(Class)] is returned and used.

By default, standard Java lang types and JSON format (with Jackson) are supported. You can supply your own ser-des by simply registering a bean of type api:mqtt.serdes.MqttPayloadSerDes[]. All ser-des implement the link:{apimicronaut}core/order/Ordered.html[Ordered] interface, so custom implementations can come before, after, or in between the default implementations.
