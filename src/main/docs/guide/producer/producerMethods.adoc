All methods that publish messages to MQTT must meet the following conditions:

* The method must reside in a class annotated with `@MqttPublisher`.
* The method must provide the topic to publish to, either through an argument, or the topic annotation on the method or class.

IMPORTANT: If the topic cannot be found, an exception will be thrown. Unless a reactive type or future is returned from the publishing method, the action is blocking.
