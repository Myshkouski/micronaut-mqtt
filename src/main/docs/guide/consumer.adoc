The example in the quick start presented a trivial definition of a class that listens for messages using the ann:mqtt.annotation.MqttSubscriber[] annotation.

The implementation that powers `@MqttSubscriber` (defined by the api:mqtt.intercept.AbstractMqttSubscriberAdvice[] class) is, however, very flexible and offers a range of options for defining MQTT consumers.
