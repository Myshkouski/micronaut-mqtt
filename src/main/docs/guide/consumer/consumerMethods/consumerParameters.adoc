In order for the consumer method to be invoked, all arguments must be satisfied. To allow execution of the method with a null value, the argument *must* be declared as nullable. If the arguments cannot be satisfied, an exception will be thrown. See the section on <<consumerExceptions, consumer exceptions>> for details on how to handle exceptions thrown during the subscription process.
