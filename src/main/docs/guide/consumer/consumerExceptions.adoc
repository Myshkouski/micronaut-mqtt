Exceptions can occur in a number of different ways. Possible problem areas include:

* Binding the message to the method arguments
* Exceptions thrown from the subscriber methods
* Exceptions as a result of message acknowledgement
* Exceptions thrown attempting to subscribe to a topic

If the subscriber bean implements api:mqtt.exception.MqttSubscriberExceptionHandler[], then exceptions will be sent to the method implementation.

If the subscriber bean does not implement api:mqtt.exception.MqttSubscriberExceptionHandler[], then the exceptions will be routed to the primary exception handler bean. To override the default exception handler, replace the api:mqtt.exception.DefaultMqttSubscriberExceptionHandler[] with your own implementation that is designated as `@Primary`.
